The drive contains training data in yolo format for both, keypoint (football field) detection as well as player detection.

Use keypoint_model_train.py to train your object classification and detection model. Here it is saved as best_mosaic_model.pt file - yolov11.
Use player_object_train.py to train your keypoint pose model. Here it is saved as best_keypoiny_model.pt file - yolov11.
